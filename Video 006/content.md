## What is Core Web Vitals?
**Core Web Vitals** are important measurements used by Google to check how good the user experience is on your website. These include:
- **LCP** (Largest Contentful Paint)
- **CLS** (Cumulative Layout Shift)
- **INP** (Interaction to Next Paint)

### Explanation of Core Web Vitals:
1. **LCP (Largest Contentful Paint)**  
   Measures how long it takes for the main content (like a big image or text) to load. The faster, the better. Aim for **under 2.5 seconds**.

2. **CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift)**  
   Measures how much the page moves around while loading. Too much movement is bad. Aim for **below 0.1**.

3. **INP (Interaction to Next Paint)**  
   Measures how quickly the page reacts after you click something. A fast response improves user experience. Aim for **under 200 ms**.
