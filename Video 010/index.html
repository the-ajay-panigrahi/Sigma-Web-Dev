    <!-- 
    Attributes for <audio> Tag
     - src: Specifies the path to the audio file.
     - controls: Adds audio controls, like play, pause, and volume.
     - autoplay: Automatically starts playing the audio when the page loads.
     - loop: Repeats the audio once it ends.
     - muted: Mutes the audio by default.
     - **preload**: Specifies if and how the audio should be loaded when the page loads ('auto', 'metadata', 'none').
 

       The "preload" attribute can have the following values:

       none: This is the default value. It indicates that the browser should not preload the audio file at all. The audio file will only start downloading when the user initiates playback.

       metadata: This value tells the browser to preload only the metadata of the audio file, such as its duration and basic information about the audio. This can be useful if you want to display the audio duration to the user without fully loading the audio data.

       auto: This value instructs the browser to preload the entire audio file as much as possible without delaying the loading of other important page content. The browser will try to load the audio file in the background so that it's ready to play when the user decides to start it.

     What is SVG?
     SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphics. Unlike raster images like PNGs or JPGs, SVGs are not pixel-based. They're composed of vectorsâ€”mathematical formulas that describe shapes, paths, and fills. This means SVGs can be resized without losing quality. 
     
     SVGs (Scalable Vector Graphics) are **vector-based** rather than pixel-based. They use mathematical equations to define shapes, lines, and colors, which means they can be scaled to any size without losing quality. Unlike pixel-based images (like PNGs or JPGs), SVGs maintain sharpness and clarity at any resolution.

     Why Use SVG?
     - Scalability:
        SVG images can be scaled indefinitely without losing quality, which is ideal for responsive web design.

     - File Size:
        SVG files are often smaller than their raster counterparts, especially for simple shapes and icons.

     - Flexibility:
        SVGs can be styled, animated, and manipulated using CSS and JavaScript.

     What is an iFrame?
     An iFrame is an HTML element that enables an inline frame for the embedding of external content. Essentially, you can load another web page within a designated area of your current webpage.

     Why Use iFrames?
     iFrames offer a variety of use-cases:

     Content Isolation: iFrames allow you to isolate third-party content, which can improve security.
     Modularity: Easily embed external plugins, widgets, or content.
     Resource Separation: Content within an iFrame can load separately from the rest of the page.
