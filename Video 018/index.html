    <!-- 
    Everything in CSS has a box around it, and understanding these boxes is key to being able to create more complex layouts with CSS, or to align items with other items. 

    The CSS Box model defines how elements are rendered and how their dimensions are calculated.

    It describes the structure of an element as a rectangular box that has content, padding, a border, and a margin.

    The box model consists of four main components, which are:-
     Content - The content of the box, where text and images appear
     Padding - Clears an area around the content. The padding is transparent
     Border - A border that goes around the padding and content
     Margin - Clears an area outside the border. The margin is transparent


     
    Margin Collapse
     Sometimes two margins collapse into a single margin.
     Top and bottom margins of elements are sometimes collapsed into a single margin that is equal to the largest of the two margins.
     This does not happen on left and right margins! Only top and bottom margins!
